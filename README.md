## Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

### Instructions
Data Modeling
* Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

### Data Engineering

Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table. 

### Data Analysis
Once you have a complete database, do the following:
* List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
* List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
* List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
* List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
* List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

### Submission
* Create an image file of your ERD.
* Create a .sql file of your table schemata.
* Create a .sql file of your queries.
* Create and upload a repository with the above files to GitHub and post a link on BootCamp Spot.
